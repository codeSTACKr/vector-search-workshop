# 👐 Create embeddings

We'll be using a fake dataset of markdown documents for a fake JavaScript library called FancyWidget.js. This set of documents can be found in the `_workshop_assets` folder of the demo repo.

If you look at the `package.js` file, you'll see the available scripts. One is called `embed` and runs a script called `createEmbeddings.mjs`. Let's take a look at this file to see what it does.

```js
import { promises as fsp } from "fs";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch } from "langchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import "dotenv/config";

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_ATLAS_URI || "");
const dbName = "docs";
const collectionName = "embeddings";
const collection = client.db(dbName).collection(collectionName);

const docs_dir = "_workshop_assets/fake_docs";
const fileNames = await fsp.readdir(docs_dir);
console.log(fileNames);
for (const fileName of fileNames) {
  const document = await fsp.readFile(`${docs_dir}/${fileName}`, "utf8");
  console.log(`Vectorizing ${fileName}`);
  
  const splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage("markdown", {
    chunkSize: 500,
    chunkOverlap: 50,
  });
  const output = await splitter.createDocuments([document]);
  
  await MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.fromDocuments(
    output,
    new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    {
      collection,
      indexName: "default",
      textKey: "text",
      embeddingKey: "embedding",
    }
  );
}

console.log("Done: Closing Connection");
await client.close();
```

This script is using the `langchain` library to create embeddings for each document in the `_workshop_assets/fake_docs` folder. It's using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split each document into chunks of 500 characters with a 50 character overlap. It's then using the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class to create embeddings for each chunk. Finally, it's using the `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch` class to store the embeddings in a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

## 🏃‍♀️ Run the script

:::tip
Be sure you have entered your OpenAI API key and MongoDB Atlas URI in the `.env` file.
:::

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
npm run embed
```

You should see output like this:

```bash
> node createEmbeddings.mjs

## 👀 View the embeddings

Now that we have created embeddings for each document, let's view them in the MongoDB Atlas UI.

1. Open the MongoDB Atlas UI and navigate to the cluster you created earlier.
2. Click the "Browse Collections" button.
3. Click the "docs" database.
4. Click the "embeddings" collection.

You should see a list of documents along with the created embeddings. Expand one of the `embedding` fields to see the entire vector embedding array.
