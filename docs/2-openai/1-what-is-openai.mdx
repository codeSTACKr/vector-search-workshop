# ðŸ“˜ What is OpenAI?

OpenAI is a company that develops AI models for natural language processing. They offer an API that you can use to create embeddings for your documents. The API is called [OpenAI's Embedding API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings).

## What is GPT?

GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer. GPT-3 was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages and was the first to be made available to the public.

In this workshop, we will be using GPT-3.5-turbo, which is a smaller version of GPT-3 that is trained on a smaller dataset of 1 million web pages. However, you can use any version of GPT that you want.

## How much does OpenAI cost?

A new OpenAI account will receive enough credits to complete this workshop. Each API call costs a fraction of a cent. If you have already exhausted your OpenAI credits, this workshop should not cost more than $0.05 to complete. You can see their pricing details [here](https://openai.com/pricing/).
