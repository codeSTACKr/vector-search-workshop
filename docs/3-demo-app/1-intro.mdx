# ðŸ“˜ Documentation application

This workshop demo application is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, OpenAI, LangChain, and the Vercel AI SDK. The starter template can be found [here](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/next-langchain).

In addition to the starter template, the `mongodb` package has also been added to the project to allow for storing and retrieving data from a MongoDB database.
