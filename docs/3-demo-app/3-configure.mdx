# üëê Configure the Application

Now that your environment is set up, you can configure the application.

Open the file `.env.example`. This file contains the configuration for the application.

The file should look like this:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR-KEY-HERE
MONGODB_ATLAS_URI=YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING-HERE
```

## Enter your OpenAI API key

Enter your OpenAI API key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` parameter. This is the key you created in the Create your OpenAI Account section.

## Enter your MongoDB connection string

To get your connection string, go back to the Atlas UI, and look for the **Connect** button.

This will provide you with a modal that offers a number of different ways to connect to your database.

Select **Compass**. While we won't be using Compass to import the data, it's an easy way to see your connection string.

Look for your connection string. It should look something like

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/
```

Enter your connection string in the `MONGODB_ATLAS_URI` parameter.

:::tip
Don't forget to replace `<password>` with the password you set when you created the cluster.

## Save and rename the file

Save the file as `.env` (without the `.example` extension).
